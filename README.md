### Hi there 👋

🦄 My name is Alistair. I'm a fifteen year old TypeScript developer with a passion for clothing and streetwear. In my spare time, I write scripts to automate the process of purchasing sought after & limited garments online to then be resold at a greater price.

🍍 I have a broad ability in full stack web development, using technologies like Cloud Computing (Serverless, AWS, Google Cloud), React.js, TypeScript, MongoDB and Node.js.
